## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend won't start:**
- Check if all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure MongoDB connection string is valid
- Make sure port 3001 is not in use

**Frontend won't start:**
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Clear your browser cache

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
# In the respective directory (backend or frontend)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**MongoDB connection issues:**
- Verify your connection string format
- Check if your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure your database user has proper permissions

**API calls failing:**
- Check if backend server is running on port 3001
- Verify CORS configuration allows frontend origin
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file to git** - it's already in `.gitignore`
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for all services
- **Rotate API keys regularly** in production
- **Use environment-specific configurations** for different deployment stages

1. **Register a new account** or **login** with existing credentials
2. **Purchase credits** through the Stripe integration (optional, some free credits may be provided)
3. **Upload documents** (PDF, TXT) or **enter text manually**
4. **Generate flashcards** using AI
5. **Study with the interactive flashcard interface**
6. **Track your progress** and **manage your account**
